# Calsync

Do you like to have one calendar that gives you a unified view of your day?
Are you annoyed that work calendar only sync with Mac's Calendar or Outlook?

This project is for you, it reads `Mac's Calendar events`, then syncs it to a Google Calendar of your choice.

WIP, not ready for public release yet, but it works.
