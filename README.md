# Calsync

Do you like to have one calendar that gives you a unified view of your day?
Are you annoyed that work calendar only sync with Mac's Calendar or Outlook?

This project is for you, it reads `Mac's Calendar events`, then syncs it to a Google Calendar of your choice.

WIP, not ready for public release yet, but it works.

https://github.com/shadyabhi/calsync/blob/main/config/testdata/config.toml

## Run CLI

```
calsync
```

## Periodically as a cron

As Mac has permissions when reading Calendar data, it is not easy to run a cronjob or launchd daemon.
For now, the workaround is [documented here](https://github.com/shadyabhi/calsync/wiki/MacOS-Cronjob).

It will take a few clicks to get it working, but it works! ðŸŽ‰
